Keep playback from stopping when the MusicKit developer token expires. The server now mints long-lived (~6 month, configurable via `MUSICKIT_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`) developer tokens instead of 1-hour ones, and the client proactively refreshes the token ahead of expiry — only while playback is paused, so it never interrupts a song.
